We just got the Bumble v0.2 operational, especially big thanks to Taras for the mechanical design here!

As you see in the video, the motion of the bot, especially the head, is extremely smooth. We decided to drop
the Dynamixel servos that were in [version 0.1](https://www.gooddog.ai/bumble/), and go instead for Brushless Gimbal
Motors that you'd typically find stabilizing the camera on an drone.

In real life, it's almost surreal watching the robot operate at this speed. The head just moves extremely smoothly, and 
completely quietly. The main drive motors are also extremely quiet. This means that the robot should end up extremely low 
maintenance, and will stand up to lots of repetitive motions without any degradation.

It's still powered by a Jetson AGX Xavier, we are hoping the price will go down on those in the future.
