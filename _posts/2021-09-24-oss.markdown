The code for GoodDog.ai is now fully open source.

[rossac - SAC training from ROS Bag files](https://github.com/GoodDogAI/rossac)

[bumble - Run ONNX models in ROS](https://github.com/GoodDogAI/bumble)

<br/>


Project Log:
 - Ability to have an arbitrary length history buffer to allow the RL network to have ability to see events in the past.
 - Currently trying just last 4 to 10 entries (a few seconds) worth of history, but some RNNs are possible with this approac
 - New YoloV5 checkpoints with higher accuracy, and fewer custom steps needed to update
 - Ability to inference YOLO's ONNX export on GPU when doing offline training  
 - Progress on "rewardbutton" bluetooth connection plus Android app
