This page will cover the 3D-printing and assembly of the 
GoodDog Bumble v0.2 robot.

**Preparing the parts for printing**

You will need to print 1 copy of each of the parts listed on this page:
[GitHub Link](https://github.com/GoodDogAI/bumble-hardware/tree/main/3mf)

That's a total of 9 parts, two of which are the gigantic case top and bottom case pieces.
I have printed everything on an [Ultimaker 2+](https://ultimaker.com/) using
[Yellow Tough PLA](https://www.matterhackers.com/store/l/pro-series-tough-pla-filament/sk/MS59VUVR).

Any printer with a 20x20cm build plate should work just as well, but you should expect around 40 hours of total print time and ~500g of material necessary.

Slicing settings needed:
 - 20% gyroid infill
 - 4 walls
 - Supports are needed on some parts, but it's doable with standard breakaway supports.

    <figcaption>Supports will be needed where the caster wheel attaches, and under the motor mounts, but be sure to use "support blocker" in your slicer to suppress it everywhere else.</figcaption>
